- 👋 Hi, I’m @emhacker, an msft employee
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and AI.
  Not advocated to any specific feild (I will not force an algorithm on a solution just because I think its cool),
    being practical and value-oriented, I will prefere the simplest solution out there.
    If it's not availible, it would be great to make one up.
  I am more than happy to share knowledge on probobalistic modeling (done a lot of stuff with Bayesian Networks) and NN.
    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about NLP.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything.
